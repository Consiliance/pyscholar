After chatting with Bruce D'Arcus <bdarcus@gmail.com> on zotero-dev@googlegroups.com, we came up with an idea for how to format scraping metadata.

(1) scraper metadata file format for mapping xpaths to particular attributes in particular classes

(2) messy data cleanup utils: for cleaning up the results of scraping, common parsing utilities.
